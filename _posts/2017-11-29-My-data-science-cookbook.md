## Changelog
### 2017-11-29
Inspired by my [lecturer](stdm.github.io) and a recent guest lecture given by an employee of Google's machine learning team, I recently got into [kaggle](www.kaggle.com) and its data science competition network as a way to both learn and understand the artificial intelligence as well as the data science field in a more meaningful way.
