Had my first work experience in a civil engineering firm in charge of infrastructure projects in Switzerland.

Always had a flair and passion for complex problem solving and mathematics.

Now working part-time as a Software Engineer at [Squibble](https://squibble.me) and studying at [ZHAW](http://www.zhaw.ch) for my bachelor's degree in computer science.
